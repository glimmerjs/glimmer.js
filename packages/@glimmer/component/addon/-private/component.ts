/**
 * The `Component` class defines an encapsulated UI element that is rendered to
 * the DOM. A component is made up of a template and, optionally, this component
 * object.
 *
 * ## Defining a Component
 *
 * To define a component, subclass `Component` and add your own properties,
 * methods and lifecycle hooks:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import Component from '@glimmer/component';
 *
 * export default class extends Component {
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Lifecycle Hooks
 *
 * Lifecycle hooks allow you to respond to changes to a component, such as when
 * it gets created, rendered, updated or destroyed. To add a lifecycle hook to a
 * component, implement the hook as a method on your component subclass.
 *
 * For example, to be notified when Glimmer has rendered your component so you
 * can attach a legacy jQuery plugin, implement the `didInsertElement()` method:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import Component from '@glimmer/component';
 *
 * export default class extends Component {
 *   didInsertElement() {
 *     $(this.element).pickadate();
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Data for Templates
 *
 * `Component`s have two different kinds of data, or state, that can be
 * displayed in templates:
 *
 * 1. Arguments
 * 2. Properties
 *
 * Arguments are data that is passed in to a component from its parent
 * component. For example, if I have a `UserGreeting` component, I can pass it
 * a name and greeting to use:
 *
 * ```hbs
 * <UserGreeting @name="Ricardo" @greeting="Olá" />
 * ```
 *
 * Inside my `UserGreeting` template, I can access the `@name` and `@greeting`
 * arguments that I've been given:
 *
 * ```hbs
 * {{@greeting}}, {{@name}}!
 * ```
 *
 * Arguments are also available inside my component:
 *
 * ```ts
 * console.log(this.args.greeting); // prints "Olá"
 * ```
 *
 * Properties, on the other hand, are internal to the component and declared in
 * the class. You can use properties to store data that you want to show in the
 * template, or pass to another component as an argument.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import Component from '@glimmer/component';
 *
 * export default class extends Component {
 *   user = {
 *     name: 'Robbie'
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * In the above example, we've defined a component with a `user` property that
 * contains an object with its own `name` property.
 *
 * We can render that property in our template:
 *
 * ```hbs
 * Hello, {{user.name}}!
 * ```
 *
 * We can also take that property and pass it as an argument to the
 * `UserGreeting` component we defined above:
 *
 * ```hbs
 * <UserGreeting @greeting="Hello" @name={{user.name}} />
 * ```
 *
 * ## Arguments vs. Properties
 *
 * Remember, arguments are data that was given to your component by its parent
 * component, and properties are data your component has defined for itself.
 *
 * You can tell the difference between arguments and properties in templates
 * because arguments always start with an `@` sign (think "A is for arguments"):
 *
 * ```hbs
 * {{@firstName}}
 * ```
 *
 * We know that `@firstName` came from the parent component, not the current
 * component, because it starts with `@` and is therefore an argument.
 *
 * On the other hand, if we see:
 *
 * ```hbs
 * {{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * We know that `name` is a property on the component. If we want to know where
 * the data is coming from, we can go look at our component class to find out.
 *
 * Inside the component itself, arguments always show up inside the component's
 * `args` property. For example, if `{{@firstName}}` is `Tom` in the template,
 * inside the component `this.args.firstName` would also be `Tom`.
