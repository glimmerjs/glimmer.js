/**
 * @decorator
 *
 * The `@cached` decorator can be used on getters in order to cache the return
 * value of the getter. This is useful when a getter is expensive and used very
 * often.
 *
 *
 * @example
 *
 * in this guest list class, we have the `sortedGuests`
 * getter that sorts the guests alphabetically:
 *
 * ```js
 * import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';
 *
 * class GuestList {
 *   @tracked guests = ['Zoey', 'Tomster'];
 *
 *   get sortedGuests() {
 *     return this.guests.slice().sort()
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Every time `sortedGuests` is accessed, a new array will be created and sorted,
 * because JavaScript getters do not cache by default. When the guest list is
 * small, like the one in the example, this is not a problem. However, if the guest
 * list were to grow very large, it would mean that we would be doing a large
 * amount of work each time we accessed `sortedGetters`. With `@cached`, we can
 * cache the value instead:
 *
 * ```js
 * import { tracked, cached } from '@glimmer/tracking';
 *
 * class GuestList {
 *   @tracked guests = ['Zoey', 'Tomster'];
 *
 *   @cached
 *   get sortedGuests() {
 *     return this.guests.slice().sort()
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Now the `sortedGuests` getter will be cached based on _autotracking_. It will
 * only rerun and create a new sorted array when the `guests` tracked property is
 * updated.
 *
 * In general, you should avoid using `@cached` unless you have confirmed that the
 * getter you are decorating is computationally expensive. `@cached` adds a small
 * amount of overhead to the getter, making it more expensive. While this overhead
 * is small, if `@cached` is overused it can add up to a large impact overall in
 * your app. Many getters and tracked properties are only accessed once, rendered,
 * and then never rerendered, so adding `@cached` when it is unnecessary can
 * negatively impact performance.
